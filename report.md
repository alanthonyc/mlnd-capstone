## Definition

### Project Overview
> high-level overview of the project; background information: problem domain, project origin, related data sets or input data

### Problem Statement
> problem statement: clearly define problem; explain strategy for solving the problem; discuss expected solution

### Metrics
> metrics: clearly define metrics used to measure performance; justify metrics based on the characteristics of the problem

## Analysis
### Data Exploration
> features and calculated statistics; sampling of data; discuss abnormalities or any other characteristics of the data that need to be addressed

### Exploratory Visualization
> summarize or extract and thoroughly discuss a relevant feature or characteristic about the dataset; clearly define visual cues

### Algorithms and Techniques
> thoroughly discuss and justify algorithms and techniques used based on the characteristics of the problem

### Benchmark
> clearly define a benchmark/threshold for comparing performances of solutions obtained

## Results
### Model Evaluation and Validation
> evaluate model qualities (i.e. parameters, etc.) in detail; validate robustness of the model's solution

### Justification
> compare final results to benchmark with some type of statistical analysis. Justify if final model or solution is enough to adequately solve problem

## Conclusion
### Free-Form Visualization
> emphasize an important quality about the project and thoroughly discuss; clearly define visual cues

### Reflection
> summarize end-to-end solution and discuss one or two interesting or difficult aspects 

### Improvement
> discuss how one aspect of the implementation can be improved; compare and contrast potential solutions from improvements to current solution
